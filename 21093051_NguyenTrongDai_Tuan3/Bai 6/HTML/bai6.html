                <p>My mother is a person I admire most. She devoted a lot of time and energy to the upbringing of my two brothers and 1. Despite working hard, she always made time to teach us many useful things which are necessary and important in our later lives. Moreover, she is a good role model for me to follow. She always tries to get on well with people who live next door and help everyone when they are in difficulties, so most of them respect and love her. I admire and look up to my mother because she not only brings me up well but also stands by me and gives some help if necessary. For example, when I encounter some difficulties, she will give me some precious advice to help me solve those problems. She has a major influence on me and 1 hope that I will inherit some of her traits.</p>

                <p>My first visit to Nha Trang, the coastal city, was three years ago. It was a pleasant and memorable trip. Nha Trang, the capital of Khanhs Hoaf province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam. In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so tempting. Waves crashing onto the cliffs; the soft sigh of the sea breeze; clean white sands and turquoise waters; it all makes for a stunning landscapes. On my visit to Nha Trang, I used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach a chance to breath in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water. One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands. Hon Tre is the largest of the islands, and Monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys. Yen island is known for its swifts’ nests. Nha Trang is the city in hamoney: its fine weather, favorite position and friendly people bring it a cerain balance. Nha Trang is a great holiday destination. I hope to have chance to come back.</p>

                <p>My favorite subject is English. The first reason I like this subject is that it is a core subject which is vital and essential in my career path. I try to learn this international language well so that I can communicate with foreigners and find a good job in the future. Fur- thermore, learning English well can help me read books or magazines in English. Through reading things in English, I can be exposed to various cultures and customs. Besides, my English teacher is a dedicated person who can engage me in her lessons and bring the passion for me. I found her lessons interesting be- cause she delivered them in a way that I really liked. In short, English is an important subject which I am really keen on.</p>

                <p>Amidst the immense mountains and forests of Lam Dong province, Dalat, a beautiful town, captivates all those who have been there once. I am one of those. Dalat is often called the City of Eternal Spring. Flowers of all colors, with many species, the most numerous of which are orchids. More than anywhere else in Viet- nam, Dalat sees flowers vie with one another in blos soming in spring. I used to get up early in the morn- ing on fine days to welcome dawn on the highlands. Opening the windows, I had a breath-taking view of nature, and enjoyed the fragrance of wild flowers car- ried by the clouds, I felt relieved in my heart. In the late afternoons, I often reserved for visits to the Valley of Love and Sigh Lake covered with quiet pine forests. Twilight on Dalat also brought many pictures and sen- sations. The wind rustling through the pine forests, the roar of waterfalls, the chirping of birds and the clatter of horse ‘s hooves….all of these unforgettable memories always remain with me.</p>

                <p>Life in the city is full of activity. Early in the morning hundreds of people rush out of their homes in the manner ants do when their nest is broken. Soon the streets are full of traffic. Shops and offices open, stu- dents flock to their schools and the day’s work begins. The city now throb with activity, and it is full of noise. Hundreds of sight-seers, tourists and others visit many places of interest in the city while businessmen from various parts of the world arrive to transact business. Then towards evening, the offices and day schools begin to close. Many of the shops too close. There is now a rush for buses and other means of transport. Everyone seems to be in a hurry to reach home. The city is described as a place of constant activity. Here, the drama of life is enacted every day.</p>
